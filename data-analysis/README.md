Over the years there have been countless icons who have graced the hardwood and change the game of basketball for years to come. People like Wilt Chamberlin, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and more recently names like Lebron James, and Stephen Curry have revolutionized not only the way the game is played on the court, but also how the rest of the world receives the sport and its players off the court. Me being a fan and a player of the sport, I decide that I wanted to take a closer look at the statistics of the NBA and see if there are any relationships between certain aspects of a player's game or background and other stats or his overall success in the leauge. Here is a brief list of some of the types of questions I hope to cover from this data:

Does a player's height have any effect on that player's shooting averages, like say their free-throw percentage?

Is there any correlation between a player's free-throw percentage and their three-point shooting percentage? If so, is it positive or negative?

Does a player's hometown or home region affect where they play in the NBA?

If a point guard scores more points, do they in turn give out less assist?

What position is the most efficient at scoring in the NBA?

What position is the most prolific with scoring in the NBA?

Does scoring distribution across positions vary from team to team in the NBA?

It has always been said that if you "feed the big man" they will be more productive. Do forwards in the league who score more also get more rebounds and/or more assist?

Is there a correlation between turnovers and fouls committed by a player? If so, is it positive or negative?

Do players who play at certain colleges perform better in the league?
